# 📦 react-toggle-use-hook

A React project that demonstrates how to build toggle functionality from scratch using custom hooks, and reuse it across multiple UI components.

---

## ✨ What this project covers

- Built toggle functionality manually instead of using libraries  
- Created and used custom hooks for reusable state logic  
- Learned about stateful behavior in React  
- Understood when to:

  - Pass a value directly to a state setter  
    ```js
    setValue(false)
    ```

  - Use the functional updater form  
    ```js
    setValue(prev => prev + 1)
    ```
